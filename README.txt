A small Python program to work with the high level Keras artificial intelligence framework with Keras.

Models were created and are found in the /models directory, these are then used alongside a tkinter Python interface.

Users can upload their own images to the program and the tensorflow convolutional neural network will give a classification from 200 categories.
